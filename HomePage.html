            Here at Medrash Madness Inc&period; we have spent a long time wondering about
		    the phenomenon of many Medrashim, such as the ones depicted above &lpar;stolen from the Little Medrash Says&rpar; 
            becoming extremely famous&comma; sometimes to the point that people
		    forget what the pasuk actually says&period; Often&comma; many people live their lives believing that certain
		    p&apos;shatim and stories are written in the Torah itself and are enormously surprised when they find
		    out otherwise&period; There are many reasons for this&comma; ranging from how preschool morahs find it most
		    interesting to teach the parshah&comma; to various well-known vertlach that are taken as undeniable fact
		    even when there are other answers given&period;
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            To that end&comma; we are pleased to announce the Medrash Madness Bracket Challenge&period; The 
            MM team of experts has worked tirelessly to compile a list of what they believe are the 64 most 
            famous Ma&apos;amarei Chazal on Chumash that are not written explicitly in the Torah&period; These have been 
            arranged in a bracket format&comma; grouped by the area of the Torah with which they are discussed&period;
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            We are calling upon you&comma; the people&comma; to participate in this exciting activity for two reasons&colon; 
            1&rpar; We would like to call everyone&apos;s attention to what is written in the Torah and what are just famous Medrashim&comma; 
            and 2&rpar; get the answer to the age-old question of what is the most well-known Torah Medrash&period; Our new website has been 
            designed to aid the implementation of this project&period; Please fill out the bracket located on the site&period; 
            Once all the brackets have been filled&comma; our analytics squad will undertake a thorough examination 
            of the results to determine the winning Medrash as well as whose bracket best corresponds to how the people voted&period; The results will be 
            announced once they have been established&period;
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            We thank you in advance for helping with this project and we look forward to what the future will bring&period;

        <h2>Instructions for Filling Out Your Bracket</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The brackets are arranged in a tournament format&comma; allowing for multiple one vs one matchups to lead to one big winner&period; 
            The two contestants are on connected horizontal lines directly above each other and the winner is written on the line 
            extending from their connector&period; You continue to work from the outside in to keep narrowing the 
            field to end up with one winner&period; &lpar;<em>See Figure 1</em>&rpar;

            Please vote on which Medrash wins each matchup based on which one you feel is the more well-known&comma; as defined by which one 
            you believe is the one that more people think is an explicit pasuk&period; &lpar;The numbers on the sides are purely for organizational 
            purposes and should not factor into your decision&period;&rpar;
